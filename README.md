## **Josep Castell**

I'm currently studying *web application development* in CIFP Francesc de Borja Moll, Mallorca.

By this moment I've worked with:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Java
   - Java Servlets
   - JDBC
- Python
- MySQL
- Nginx
- Tomcat
- Docker

As I'm new in this developing world I like every field, and I have curiosity about how everything works.

I'm specially interested in frontend developing.
